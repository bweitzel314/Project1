This project contains the files for a functional travel booking website. It's home page is a html page with destination cards for different travel locations. When the user clicks on a card, they are redirected to a page that displays more about that location as well a section to book a trip to that selected location. The detailed page for each destination includes a high quality image of the location, an embeded map, a list of things to do, and the booking form. The pages are displayed using html and javascript. The data for the destinations is stored in a json file, which is fetched by a javascript file. Two javascript files work with the two html pages, the main menu and the destination details page, to provide user interaction and show details of the desinations accordingly. To style the pages, css is used.
